## Introduction
____
In addition to the in-memory invocation method, the Port application inherently provides a REST API.

It offers the following advantages:

1.Resource-centric: Every resource has a unique identifier (URI), and each resource is accessed through its unique URI.

2.Utilization of HTTP Methods: Manipulation of resources is done using HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE). For example, GET is used for retrieving resources, and POST is used for creating new resources.

3.State Transfer of Representations: Clients send representations of the resources they request to the server, which processes them and responds with appropriate status codes.

4.Statelessness: Servers handle each request independently, without storing any client state. This enhances scalability and performance.

5.Caching: Servers can cache responses to improve client performance.


## Authentication
____
When authentication functionality is activated within the HOST application, service-calling applications are required to request a key from the HOST before making 
API calls to ensure proper authentication and access to services. This security feature remains disabled by default.
