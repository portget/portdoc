# What's API?
__________________

API stands for Application Programming Interface. It is a set of rules and protocols that allows different software applications to communicate with each other. APIs define the methods and data structures that developers can use to interact with an application's software components, like its services, functions, or data.
Port provides an APIObject within their SDK, making it easier to develop APIs. This allows users to develop applications more easily and flexibly using REST API or GraphQL.
