Try creating and editing a basic project to see how you can modify and configure projects. Follow along to understand the process better. How to create a port-project \u00b6 Before starting a Port project, you need to create a root folder that defines your messages. The subfolders within this root folder are managed as groups by Port, allowing users to organize messages by group. The root folder contains files with the *.enum extension and the structure of sub-group folders. Within the sub-group folders, message definition documents with the *.msg extension are created. Project Repository \u00b6 The Port project is remarkably simple and straightforward. To get started, first create a project folder in the console, then type port new sample. This will quickly generate the project files. After that, create sub-group folders and add .msg files to each sub-group folder. Feel free to create messages using text, num, and enum types as you like. Once you've specified the attributes, type port push and Port will automatically store everything. Now, just run port run sample, and the server will start, allowing you to safely and easily share messages across multiple applications. Tip The repository name cannot contain special characters. It follows the directory naming rules provided by the operating system. Create a project Group \u00b6 A group serves as the root of messages. Within a single group, multiple message files can be stored, allowing for easy retrieval and editing. By managing several .msg files within the group folder, you can conveniently organize and abstract them for streamlined management. Add a group Project Layouts \u00b6 sample // project root directory \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 room1 // messsage directory \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 *.msg \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 room2 // messsage directory \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 *.msg \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 app //application directory \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 *.enum \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 *.rule \u2502 \u2514\u2500\u2500 proj.toml How to add messages \u00b6 To declare a message, you need to edit the *.msg file in the sub-folder you created. By defining message data types and attributes as shown below, you can later utilize various features such as automatic logging and backup. Additionally, you can define relationships using predefined relations. Message Structure \u00b6 A message is an object that allows users to specify pkg properties in a pre-provided Application Service. The message is a kv, and types and properties can be defined in that message. Please attach the materials attached below. message item format like this [key] [datatype] [option...] [key] - unique key in the message group [datatype] - text | num | enum [attribute] - pkg,backup,rule,frame,property datatype \u00b6 name range description text 0~255 The length can be specified as a value from 0 to 255. num -1.7e+308 ~ +1.7e+308 The floating-point type that allows for the representation of decimal numbers and is capable of representing a wide range of values, both very small and very large. enum 0 ~ 65535 The user can utilize the fixed list values specified in the .enum file, which can be used at a lower cost than text values and with stricter usage. attribute \u00b6 name description pkg Real-time synchronization and messaging are handled within the corresponding external library. For more details, please refer to the pkg documentation. backup Changes are saved to the backup database as they occur, ensuring that values are restored upon application restart. and values are not propagated pkg messages during program execution. property Can specify a custom property rule Can specify rules to manage the values of corresponding messages. logging logging Tip message document do not using special characters. Sample message files \u00b6 BulbOnOff enum.OffOn pkg:Blub1.OffOn RoomTemp1 num pkg:Heater1.Temp property:{\"MIN\":0,\"MAX\":300,\"Arguments\":\"C\"} RoomTemp2 num pkg:Heater1.Temp property:{\"MIN\":0,\"MAX\":300,\"Arguments\":\"F\"} How to add enums \u00b6 Enum file \u00b6 Enums are particularly useful when you have a fixed set of values that a variable can take, such as days of the week, months of the year, or status codes. They help make your code more expressive, self-documenting, and less error-prone because you're working with named constants instead of raw integer values. enum item format like this [key] [item-name:number_key] [item-name:number_key] [key] - unique key in the enum message [item-name] - name by enum-item [property] - unique key in enum value Sample enum files \u00b6 TFalse True:0 False:1 FTrue False:0 True:1 OffOn Off:0 On:1 OnOff On:0 Off:1 How to add rules \u00b6 To declare a rule, you need to edit the *.rule file in the sub-folder you created. The rule script can control whether the user can modify settings through the setable function. The first parameter is the condition that triggers the rule, and the second parameter is the condition that determines whether the setting is modifiable. When the user changes the message value, the function is automatically called to check these conditions. Set-Rule script syntax \u00b6 set( [group.message-name][operator][value] , [script] ) GetTrigger script syntax \u00b6 Overview The get function serves as a conditional trigger mechanism for executing specific actions when defined conditions are met. It is composed of two main parts: Trigger Condition: A logical expression that evaluates to true or false. Action Script: A set of instructions executed when the trigger condition evaluates to true. Syntax get(\" \", \" \"); Parameters Trigger Condition (String): A logical expression enclosed in double quotes (\"), specifying the condition to be evaluated. The condition may include variables, comparison operators, and logical connectors. Examples: (room1.RoomTemp1 >= 0) && (room2.RoomTemp2 >= 0) device.Status == \"ON\" || sensor.Value < 50 Action Script (String): A series of commands, separated by semicolons (;), executed if the trigger condition evaluates to true. Each command consists of a variable assignment, setting a specific state or value. Examples: room1.BulbOnOff = Off; room2.BulbOnOff = Off; device.Power = \"OFF\"; alert.Level = \"High\"; Execution Flow Evaluation Phase: The Trigger Condition is evaluated. If the condition is true, proceed to the action phase. If false, no further steps are executed. Action Phase: The Action Script is executed sequentially. Commands in the script modify states or perform actions as defined. Examples Example 1: Temperature-Based Trigger get(\"(room1.RoomTemp1 >= 0) && (room2.RoomTemp2 >= 0)\", \"room1.BulbOnOff = Off; room2.BulbOnOff = Off;\"); Description: Trigger Condition: Checks if RoomTemp1 in room1 and RoomTemp2 in room2 are greater than or equal to 0. Action Script: Turns off the bulbs in room1 and room2 if the condition is satisfied. Example 2: Device Status Monitoring get(\"device.Status == 'ON'\", \"device.Power = 'OFF'; alert.Level = 'High';\"); Description: Trigger Condition: Verifies if the device's status is \"ON\". Action Script: Sets the device power to \"OFF\" and raises the alert level to \"High\". Supported Features Comparison Operators: >=, <=, >, <, ==, != Logical Connectors: && (AND), || (OR) Variables: Accessed using dot notation (e.g., room1.RoomTemp1) Value Types: Numbers (e.g., 0, 50) and strings (e.g., 'ON', 'OFF'). Notes Ensure all variables used in the Trigger Condition and Action Script are defined and accessible. Enclose string values in single quotes (') within conditions and assignments. Separate multiple commands in the Action Script using semicolons (;). Troubleshooting Condition Always False: Verify the logical expression and ensure variable values are updated correctly. No Action Executed: Check that the Trigger Condition evaluates to true as expected. By following this manual, users can effectively utilize the get function to automate conditional tasks and actions. Syntax get( [group-name.message-name][operator][value] , [script] ) Sample rule files \u00b6 set(\"room1.BulbOnOff==Off\",\"(room1.RoomTemp1>=20)&&(room2.RoomTemp2>=20)\") set(\"room1.RoomTemp2>=30\",\"room2.RoomTemp2>=5\") get(\"(room1.RoomTemp1>=0)&&(room2.RoomTemp2>=0)\",\"room1.BulbOnOff=Off;room2.BulbOnOff=Off;\") How to link packages \u00b6 Check packages \u00b6 port ls pkg package1 [DateTime] package2 [DateTime] package3 [DateTime] package4 [DateTime] Add packages \u00b6 move directory \u00b6 cd C:\\Users\\Demo Add the package to the current project under the name \"bulb1\" \u00b6 port add --pkg bulb1 bulb Add the package to the current project under the name \"bulb2\" \u00b6 port add --pkg bulb2 bulb Add the package to the current project under the name \"heater1\" \u00b6 port add --pkg heater1 heater Add the package to the current project under the name \"heater2\" \u00b6 port add --pkg heater2 heater Tip If you see a message like [ERROR][open ..\\proj.toml: Access is denied.] granting administrator privileges to the port.exe program will resolve the issue. After linking the relations to your project, you can verify the integration using the following command How to start project \u00b6 Once all message definitions are complete, you can start the message server based on these definitions. Before running the server, upload all updated content to the local repository by entering port push in the console. Then, run the server with the command port run [project-name] . port push port run sample [localhost:5001]Port Running ... OK Access point count [4] Package count [2] Pressing 'CTRL + C' will initiate server shutdown. Please wait for all processes to safely terminate before closing the application. Tip When running the server, if you include --ng ignore in the command, it will summarize only the points where errors (NG) occur. For detailed information on these NG points, you can visit the following URL to view the NG point table: http://localhost:5001/api/app/ng/?view=table Good luck! \u00b6 Download sample project .console { width: 80%; height: 80%; background-color: whitesmoke; color: black; padding: 20px; box-sizing: border-box; border-radius: 8px; box-shadow: 0 0 10px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5); overflow-y: auto; } .yellow{ color:yellow; } .console-content { white-space: pre-wrap; } .console-content p { margin: 0; } .notepad { width: 100%; height: 80%; background-color: white; color: black; padding: 20px; box-sizing: border-box; border-radius: 8px; box-shadow: 0 0 10px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5); overflow-y: auto; } .notepad:before { content: ''; position: absolute; top: 10px; left: 20px; right: 20px; height: 2px; background-color: #ccc; } .notepad:after { content: ''; position: absolute; top: 30px; left: 20px; right: 20px; height: 2px; background-color: #ccc; } .notepad-content { margin-top: 40px; } .notepad-content p { margin: 0 0 10px; line-height: 1.5; }","title":"Learn"},{"location":"learn/#quick-start","text":"Port operates by reflecting messages in the most recently updated repository.

Once an SSH connection is successfully established, a shell session begins, allowing users to interact with and control the remote server by executing commands from their local computer. Widely used by system and network administrators, SSH is an essential tool for managing remote servers and machines. Its robust security features make it indispensable for anyone needing to remotely access and manage computers with a high degree of security. How Does SSH Work? \u00b6 Both the client and server actively contribute to establishing a secure SSH communication channel. The process involves several key components and steps: Client-Side Component: The client-side component is a software application or program used to connect to a remote machine. It initiates the connection by sending the remote host's information to the server. Once the provided credentials are verified, the program establishes an encrypted connection, allowing secure communication. Server-Side Component: On the server side, an SSH daemon continuously listens on a designated TCP/IP port (typically port 22, the default for SSH) for incoming connection requests. When a client attempts to connect via this port, the SSH daemon responds by sharing the supported software and protocol versions. The default protocol version for SSH communication is version 2, as version 1 has been deprecated due to security vulnerabilities. Authentication: During the connection process, the client provides authentication credentials to the server. This can include methods like username/password combinations, cryptographic key pairs, or multi-factor authentication. Once the server verifies the credentials, it establishes a new encrypted session for secure communication.

It is widely used for remotely accessing servers and systems over a network. PuTTY allows users to interact with remote machines via a command-line interface, making it a valuable tool for system administrators, developers, and IT professionals.
